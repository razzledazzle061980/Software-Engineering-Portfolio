## <u>CS-302 Software Security</u>
<dd>In this course I learned how to analyze using advanced security concepts, how to develop secure code.  
  Learned how to apply encryption techniques to communicate and transmit data securely.  
  This course also taught me how to run vulnerability tests on plug-ins and code and how to resolve any vulnerabilities found.</dd>

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
  <dd> 
    The projects for this course asked me to refactor code and run vulnerability scans on the code and plug-ins.
    Through the use of the tools I was able to effectively resolve all vulnerability and security concerns 
    caused by refactoring code.

1.  Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?  
   Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans and they wanted to secure their file transfer 
2.  What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?  
   Coding securely reduces the amount of bugs that will be introduced to software.  I don't think there is one thing I did particularly well when finding vulnerabilities.
3.  What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?  
   Detecting the false positives were incredibly difficult to me.
4.  How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?  
   I will use industry standards techniques to access vulnerabilities and to decide the mitigation techniques to use.
5.  How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?  
   Using IDE plugins that constantly scan code for vulnerabilities.
6.  What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
   Using a plugin such as Snyk will definitely be helpful in the future.  Using industry standards and guidelines to ensure the code I am writing is correct.
7.  Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?  
   I will direct them to my website that gives an outline of my skills and a list of courses which will take them to the specifics of that course.
