## <u>CS-350 Emerging Systems Architecture & Technologies</u>
<dd>Explored emerging systems, architecture and technologies.  Analyzed fundamental issues in architecture designs and the impact on application performance to enable better understanding of concepts.   Evaluated software architectures and determined when to implement architectures and technologies to fulfill needs.

      This course solely focused on the C++ programming language and interacting with a Texas Instrument CC3220S development board. For the final project we were task with creating an application that would interface with microcontrollers to act as a thermostat.

* Learned how to use GPIO, timers, interrupts to illuminate LEDs, output message via serial connection and receive button input. 
* Discovered and utilized state machines and learned how they can be used to maintain the state of various peripherals.
* Implemented a task scheduler using timers that would simultaneously execute multiple tasks, using button interrupts the desired temperature of the thermostat could be set and an LED showed the status.
