## <u>CS-350 Emerging Systems Architecture & Technologies</u>
<dd>Explored emerging systems, architecture and technologies.  Analyzed fundamental issues in architecture designs and the impact on application performance to enable better understanding of concepts.   Evaluated software architectures and determined when to implement architectures and technologies to fulfill needs.

  <dd>
      This course solely focused on the C++ programming language and interacting with a Texas Instrument CC3220S development board. For the final project we were task with creating an application that would interface with microcontrollers to act as a thermostat.   
</dd>

* Learned how to use GPIO, timers, interrupts to illuminate LEDs, output message via serial connection and receive button input. 
* Discovered and utilized state machines and learned how they can be used to maintain the state of various peripherals.
* Implemented a task scheduler using timers that would simultaneously execute multiple tasks, using button interrupts the desired temperature of the thermostat could be set and an LED showed the status.

* **What did I do particular well?**   
   The one area I believe I did exceptionally would be state management.  I was able to think outside the box and utilize state in some unique ways.  
    
* __Where could you improve?__  
  One major improvement I could have would have to be my interaction with the IDE and the SDK.  Up until the last assignment I was having difficulties with the IDE and SDK.  My dislike for the IDE and issues with the SDK caused undue delays.  
    
* __What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?__  
  The skills and knowledge I learned in the course are monumental, the experience with interacting with embedded devices and being able to solidify my knowledge in C++ will go a long way.  Now, with being able to configure and develop and application on embedded devices is a huge confidence booster and will stick with me.  
    
* __How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?__  
  Commenting the code according to industry standards will make it very readable, also grouping functions and variables together based on functionality will make it easier to locate code.  By properly commenting all the code will make maintaining and adapting it very easy.
