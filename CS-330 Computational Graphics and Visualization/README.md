    <dd>In this course we used the OpenGL library to create a 3D scene using C++, each week we would use the previous weeks assignments and milestones to build new skills.
    I learned how to create 3D primitive objects, how to apply colors, textures, transform shapes by scaling, rotating, and relocating objects.  We also learned how to move around
      inside of an environment, create shaders, lighting and reflection.
