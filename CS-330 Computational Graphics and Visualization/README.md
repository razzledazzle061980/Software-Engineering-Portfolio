    <dd>In this course we used the OpenGL library to create a 3D scene using C++, each week we would use the previous weeks assignments and milestones to build new skills.
    I learned how to create 3D primitive objects, how to apply colors, textures, transform shapes by scaling, rotating, and relocating objects.  We also learned how to move around
      inside of an environment, create shaders, lighting and reflection.

1.  How do I approach designing software?  
   I approach designing software with an open mind.  I developed new skills in C++ which I used in this course which helped me create the scene in this course.
2.  How do I approach developing programs?
   Using the knowledge gained through the current and previous milestones allowed me to address and complete the then current milestone.
3.  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   It allowed my C++ skills to increase and I learned new techniques which will allow me to develop better C++ code in the future.
