/**
*  Pet Check-In
   The method for the pet check in process should meet the following criteria:
    • Determine if the pet is a dog or a cat and check for boarding space.
    • There are 30 spaces for dogs and 12 for cats. Pet BAG will need to be able to adjust these counts
        as the shop grows.
    • If there is space for a new pet, collect the appropriate information. For returning pets, update
        the information as needed.
    • Gather information on the length of the stay.
    • Determine if the pet owner would like the pet to be groomed. Only dogs can be groomed and
        only if they stay two or more days.
    • Assign the pet to a space.
