## <u>CS-465 Full Stack Development</u>
<dd>
    Learned and exercised designing and developing full stack applications using programming language frameworks.  Created a database and
    developed the code to interface it with an application

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
  <dd>
      The project in this course used NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Angular to develop a full stack application with a finished admin site including authentication. 
</dd>

* Used Express to create a static web site and api server.
* Created a MongoDB database and interfaced it with admin and customer sites.
* Developed admin site using Angular and leveraged MongoDB to store information used on site.

   ## Architecture
   ---

  <dt>Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).</dt>
<dd>Express framework was used as the web server to serve the web pages for the static HTML site.  Angular was used in tandem with JavaScript to create the SPA.
</dd> 

* **Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**
<dd>MongoDB was used because it is lightweight, easy to implement with Angular, Express, NodeJS and JavaScript. </dd>


* **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**   
<dd>As a computer scientist I would approach a problem by first stating what the problem is and the desired result.  From there determine the best steps to take in order to resolve the problem and reach the desired outcome.  My approach to the assignments in this course has not differed from the approach taken in other courses.</dd>  
  
<dd>In the future I would use the same techniques I currently use and have used in the past. Basically use the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) approach, get the requirements for the database including specifics as to the database type, programming languages and integreations, design the database using the requirements, create the database based on the design, test the database using the requirements set forth in the gathering stage and finally deliver the product to the client.</dd>  

* **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

<dd>Computer Scientists solve problems by designing and developing software or hardware used to solve problem in various different technologies.  One of the most important jobs a computer scientist does is to develop or design model for interaction between people and software or computers.</dd>

<dd>Computer scientist essentially make our lives easier by solving problems that make things difficult.  So for the project in this course the goal would be to make it easier for the client to find all animals applicable for a certain type of rescue team.</dd>
