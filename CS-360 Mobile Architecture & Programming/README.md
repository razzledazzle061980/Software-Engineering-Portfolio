## <u>CS-360 Mobile Architecture & Programming</u>
<dd>In this course I learned the principles and best practices for developing mobile applications on the Android platform.  I learned how to use Android Studio to create Android applications and the proper techniques to use the most up-to-date components.

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
  <dd> 
    In this course I created three projects, in project one I simply laid how my plans for designing the mobile application which included all the 
    screens needed to create an application, in project two I took what I said would be my design in project one and actually created the interface
    for the application in Android Studio which resulted in a working UI and finally, in project three I built on project two by adding functionality
    to the UI I had created.  This functioning mobile application included authentication against a local SQLite 3 database in which users could use
    the applications register page to create a new user, the application would check to make sure the username in question did not aleady exist.  Upon
    success registrations, users could login to the application which would take them to the inventory items page.  The users had the ability to add 
    new items, edit existing items and delete items.  All of which was functional in the application.
    <dd>The application also had feature such as detecting a users last login and if the user had last logged in within 30 
    minutes it would automatically them back in taking them to the items page.  It has a remember me so if checked 
    the users username would automatically be inserted the next time they opened the application.</dd>

1.  Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 
    <dd>The needs for the applications was to allow users to store inventory items in the application, the users should be able
    to add and remove items, they should be able to edit existing items with the ability to update the number of items in stock.  
    The application should also support the features of being able to login to the application to access their inventory.</dd>
2.  What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in
    mind? Why were your designs successful?  
    <dd>The screens necessary were as follows:  login, register, item, new/edit item.  My UI design kept users in mind because it delievered
    the requirements of the software and it was successful because I adhered to industry standards and used Google's design layouts.</dd>
3.  How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?  
    <dd>The approach that I took was to use the course materials, techniques learned throughout the course and guidelines set forth by Google to 
    figure the best way to structure the application so it would accomplish the requirements.  If I were to develop a mobile application in the
    future I would have a more laid out plan with a concrete set of guidelines to follow.</dd>
4.  How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?  
    <dd>I ensured the code was functional by running the emulator and actually performing the various tasks one at a time, correcting errors along the
    way.  While I know my process may not be the most optimal or correct way of doing things but based on time it was the best way to complete the
    tasks.</dd>
5.  Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a
    challenge?  
    <dd>During the last project I was constantly having to innovate to overcome challenges because the components I used in my application were not
    covered in our course materials and the Android developers site did not go into detail as to how they were to be developed and implemented.</dd>
6.  In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? 
    <dd>I feel like I did the login and register screens successfully, primarily because they were centered more towards backend coding of Java which
    I'm very comfortable with so coding the logic was an area where I could use my skills and knowledge to create the desired affect.</dd>
