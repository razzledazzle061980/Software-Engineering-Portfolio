## <u>CS-320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance</u>
<dd>Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, 
including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and 
analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.

    <dd>
      This course had two projects, the first project I had to create software tests from code based on previous modules.  I was 
      tasked with conducting these tests using current industry standards while maintaining the most code coverage possible.  In
      project two I basically gave an ouline of project one in which I had to explain the ways I performed the tests and the
      success of those tests

1.  How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
    <dd>
       The first way you ensure code or software is functional is if you run the softwware.  If the software compiles and runs
       it is functional, it may not be secure but it functions.  Another way is by writing tests that address security concerns,
       making sure to address each class and method in the test and making sure 100% code coverage in tests is acheived.
    </dd>
2.  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
    <dd>
       I interpret user needs by the requirements set forth by the client during the planning stage. Then using those requirements
       create UML use case diagrams or another diagram that outlines the requirements for the software.  Then using those diagrams
       I incorporate the needs and/or requirements into the software.
    </dd>
3.  How do I approach designing software? 
    <dd>
       I approach application design with an opened mind and no preconceived notions on what the application will look like, what 
       the requirements are and how it will be developed.  I then use past experiences and ideas to allow me to ask the customer 
       questions that are beneficial to the design of an application.  If I encounter a request from the customer that is 
       impossible or introduces security concerns, I let them know this and offer alternatives that may serve the same purpose.  
       If they agree, then I will add that alternative into the requirements.  I took a UI/UX class a couple months ago that 
       really opened my eyes to how much science actually goes into UI/UX design rather than just having a creative mind which I 
       thought was a requirement to create a good UI/UX.
