## <u>CS-370 Current and Emerging Trends In Computer Science</u>
<dd>
    Explorer the advanced topics in Computer Science by analyzing authentic scenarios.  Investigated the roles of ethics in current trends within the field and applied fundamental concepts to solve complex problems in new ways.

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
  <dd>
      This course had two projects, for the first project I had to explain neural networks, how they send information and how GDPR would be used to regulate AI.  The second project I was tasked with creating an AI that would play a game in which it had to figure out how to navigate a maze and win.
</dd>

* Applied reinforced learning to develop an Q-Learning algorithm that would play the maze game
* Python was written to develop the algortithm
* Developed a model to which the AI would be trained.

* **What code were you given?**   
<dd>I was given the basic building blocks of the application.  Three files were given which contained everything but the algorithm itself.  The maze and most of the functionality was given with the exception of the algorithm for the training of the model. </dd>


* **What code did you create yourself?**   
<dd>I had to develop the Q-learning algorithm which was the logic behind the AI.  I had to incorporate the existing code provided into a training model that the agent could learn and win the game.</dd>   

* **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**

<dd>Computer Scientists solve problems by designing and developing software or hardware used to solve problem in various different technologies.  One of the most important jobs a computer scientist does is to develop or design model for interaction between people and software or computers.</dd>

<dd>Computer scientist essentially make our lives easier by solving problems that make things difficult.  So for the project in this course the goal would be to make it easier for the client to find all animals applicable for a certain type of rescue team.</dd>

* **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
<dd>As a computer scientist I would approach a problem by first stating what the problem is and the desired result. From there determine the best steps to take in order to resolve the problem and reach the desired outcome. My approach to the assignments in this course has not differed from the approach taken in other courses.</dd>

* **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
<dd>It is my job as a software engineer to make sure the software that I or a team I am on develops does not cause ethical concerns or violates any laws for the state or country to which it was developed in.  Currently, there are no standards or guidelines to guide developers in creating software that is ethically sound.  So it falls on the developer or engineer to make sure it raises no concerns.</dd>
