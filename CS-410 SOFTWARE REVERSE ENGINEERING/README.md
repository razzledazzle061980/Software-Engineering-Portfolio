## <u>CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering</u>
<dd>I learned the basics of reverse engineering specific to software development.  I examined the process of how reverse engineering makes new software products, enhance the functionality and recreate code for applications.  I discovered how fundamental reverse engineering technologiesand practices for maintaining and security-related use cases.

  <dd>In this course there were two projects, both projects involved the breaking down of binary code into assembly code which was then used to create .cpp files.  In project two I did the same thing but this time I turned my .cpp file into executable code and then took that executable and decompiled it into binary code.
