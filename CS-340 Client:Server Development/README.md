## <u>CS-340 Client/Server Development</u>
<dd>
    Learned how to apply database system concepts and principles to develop client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases.

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
  <dd>
      This course had two projects, both projects use the Python and MongoDB databases.  Project One I performed various different CRUD actions.  Project Two involved creating a dashboard using the Dash framework. 
</dd>

* Created Python CRUD methods to interact with MongoDB.
* Implemented the Dash framework in Python to create a dashboard driven by data from a MongoDB.
* Used Plotly and Leaflet to incorporate charts and maps into the dashboard.

* **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**   
<dd>Follow industry standard and guidelines to name functions, methods and add comments that clearly state the purpose of the function or method and how it is to be used.  The advantage of working with a CRUD that is modular reduces development times and it can used in a variety of projects with little to not modifications.</dd>


* **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**   
<dd>As a computer scientist I would approach a problem by first stating what the problem is and the desired result.  From there determine the best steps to take in order to resolve the problem and reach the desired outcome.  My approach to the assignments in this course has not differed from the approach taken in other courses.</dd>  
  
<dd>In the future I would use the same techniques I currently use and have used in the past. Basically use the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) approach, get the requirements for the database including specifics as to the database type, programming languages and integreations, design the database using the requirements, create the database based on the design, test the database using the requirements set forth in the gathering stage and finally deliver the product to the client.</dd>  

* **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

<dd>Computer Scientists solve problems by designing and developing software or hardware used to solve problem in various different technologies.  One of the most important jobs a computer scientist does is to develop or design model for interaction between people and software or computers.</dd>

<dd>Computer scientist essentially make our lives easier by solving problems that make things difficult.  So for the project in this course the goal would be to make it easier for the client to find all animals applicable for a certain type of rescue team.</dd>
