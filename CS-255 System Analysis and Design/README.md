## <u>CS-244 System Analysis and Design</u>
<dd>In this course I learned the principles, methods, and techniques used for system development.  This allowed me to create system models using industry standards and to effectively communicate the concepts and designs to various audiences.  Throughout the course we were asked to learn about and use models and diagrams.</dd>

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
    <dd>In the projects for this course we were tasked with creating a business requirement document, application model, Powerpoint presentation and a system design.  Included in these documents were numerous system UML diagrams such as Activity, Class, Sequence and Use Case diagrams.</dd>

## 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission
1.  Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  
   The client was DriverPass, the project was creating a web application that would aid their customers in passing driver's test by  
    providing them with online training, online practice tests and in-person driving lessons with a trainer. 
2. What did you do particularly well?  
   I believe the diagrams is one area I did really well, I think I did a great job showing the process of users logging in to the system.  There are other areas that I believe I did well but that is the area I believe I excelled.  
5.  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
6.  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
7.  How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
