## <u>CS-470 Full Stack Development II</u>
<dd>
    Learned how to develop a full stack application that runs in the cloud.  Using cloud-based development principles and best practices, I was able to take a software stack from CS-465 Full Stack Development I and utilize frameworks to build the cloud architecture upon which an application will run.  Demonstrated career-readiness by articulating highly technical content to various audiences and in various formats.

    <dt><h4><u>Projects Overview</u></h4></dt>
  <dd>
      This course had two projects, the first project involved the setup, implementation and deployment of my application to cloud services.  The second project was a presentation in which the concept of cloud services and various different services used in this course to produce a cloud-based application.
</dd>

* Created, setup and implementation of AWS cloud services
* Configured the security of the AWS services used
* Defined roles and policies to dictate how AWS services interact with one another

* **Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.**   
  <dd>This course has increased my skills which makes me more marketable which I hope ultimately will help me reach my professional goals.</dd>


* **What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**   
<dd>I have learned how to take an application that is containerized and deploy it to AWS cloud services.  It helped me develop a better understanding of AWS cloud services, the proper way they came be setup, secured and deployed.  I believe all of this will make me more marketable.</dd>


* **Describe your strengths as a software developer.**   
<dd>My strengths as a developer would be my adaptability, quick learner and great communicator.</dd>


* **Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.**   
<dd>I am prepared to assume the roles of a software engineer and/or software developer.</dd>


* **Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future.**   
<dd>In a serverless service such as that offered by AWS, scaling is handled automatically.  Predicting the cost can be done with Forecasting via Cost Explorer.  This requires that services run for a period of time so a forecast can be created based on past usages.  Containers run all the time with no impact to the amount of resources used so therefore the predictability of cost is going to be more with containers, however, if enough data is available for forecasting the narrower the predicted monthly cost range will be.</dd>  


* **Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.**   
<dd>Deciding factors in plans for expansion would be cost, scalability, availability, security and deployment times.  The pros of using AWS cloud services is reduced cost, resource scalability, high-availability, increased security and faster deployment times.  Some of the cons would be a learning definite learning curve, and limited control of resources.</dd> 


* **What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?**   
<dd>Elasticity and Pay-For-Service play an important role in the decision making process for planned future growth.  Elasticity is the ability for a service to be scaled up or down to meet resource demand.  Pay-As-You-Go billing means you only pay for the usage of resources.  These two together could have a profound impact on plans for future growth because these two can dramatically impact billing costs.</dd>
